Project - To identify a tweet whether it is fake or genuine

Since the project is created in Spider(Anaconda)
one can run into the parts of program too
There is two algorithms included into it for classifying the bots and humans for their tweets
most of the python snippets in fetch_data.py

Firstly we need to fetch the data from twitter that is done using tweepy library and their api methods
file- fetch_data.py

after this with machine learning algorithms can able to classify the twitter accounts for the their tweets
file- main.py

how to run main.py
-run upto commented "Naive_Bayes algorithm"
-now to view the results from naive bayes algorithm run the code from commented naive_bayes algorithm to commented KNN classifer algorithm
-to view the results from KNN classifier run the code from commented KNN classifier algorithm to end of the code
